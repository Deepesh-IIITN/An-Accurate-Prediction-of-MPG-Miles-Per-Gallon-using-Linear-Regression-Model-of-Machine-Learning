# An-Accurate-Prediction-of-MPG-Miles-Per-Gallon-using-Linear-Regression-Model-of-Machine-Learning
Abstract: Considering the growth of the automobile industry coming across since the past two centuries, we are witnessing the increasing fuel prices and customers being more particular about the features, the automobile makers are constantly optimising their processes to increase fuel efficiency. But what if you could have a reliable estimator for a car's MPG given some known specifications about the vehicle? Then, you could beat a competitor in the market by both having a more desirable vehicle that is also more efficient, improve the fuel economy and bring more demand and supply to the consumers. We are implementing Machine Learning to design the prediction models and minimise the RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) value in between 1 and 2 of the automobiles made (in MPG) in the past years.
